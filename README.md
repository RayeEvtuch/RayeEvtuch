Hey there, I’m Raye. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Perhaps you’d like to know a little bit more [about me](https://raye.evtuch.net/about-me), to read my extensive [resume](https://raye.evtuch.net/cv), or to know my preference for the Oxford comma. It’s also possible you were reading something super exciting on [my blog](https://queensidecastle.com/) that landed you here.

You may know me by my prior name, Scott Evtuch. That’s me! In case you don’t believe me, you can tell for sure by my [public keys](https://raye.evtuch.net/crypto) I suppose.

Expecting more? [Contact](https://raye.evtuch.net/contact) me and let me know what I missed.
